# Number-Guesser!
###Partner Project

In this project our objective was to create a number guesser game that came as close as possible to the comp provided. In this project we developed greater HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. In this game two users can play a number guessing game where they enter their guess, a card displays whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, and then a winner card is generated for the player who guesses correct. We completed most aspects of Phases 1-3.

### Phase 1:
In phase 1 we managed to get the game visually comparable to the comp and responsive. All input fields and buttons are fully functional as well as the card that displays the users name, guess, and whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The clear and reset buttons are also disabled when not in use.

#### Phase 2:
In phase 2 we made sure that the range and guess inputs only accepted numerical values. We also designed error messages to display whenever an input was invalid.

### Phase 3:
In phase 3 we were able to get a winer card to display once a player guessed the correct number. The card displays the winners name and who they challanged. These cards can also be removed when the circular X button is clicked. 

Below are visual examples of our project vs the comp:
